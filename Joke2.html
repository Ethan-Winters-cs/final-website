<h1>Hello This is the second joke of world's famous joke site!</h1>
<p>
<b>The Librarian and Ghost</b>? <br>
A woman goes into a library and asks the librarian, "Do you have any books on ghosts?" <br>
The librarian looks at her, then replies, "Sure, we have plenty, but they&apos;re all checked out." <br>
"Oh, I guess they&apos;re haunting someone else," the woman says. <br>
The librarian shrugs and says, "Well, the ghost story section is the most popular. They really <i>spirit away.</i>" <br>
