<h1>Hello This is the third joke of world's famous joke site!</h1>
<p>
<b>The Interview </b><br>
Interviewer: So, tell me a bit about your previous job experience and why you think you’re a good fit for this position. <br>

Yes Man: <b>YES</b>! I have extensive experience in customer service, leadership, and problem-solving. I’m very adaptable and always ready to help with any challenges. <br>

Interviewer: That’s good to hear. But can you give me an example of a particularly challenging situation you handled? <br>

Yes Man: <b>YES</b>! There was a situation where we had a major issue with product delays. I worked with the team to ensure customer satisfaction by offering quick solutions and keeping everyone updated. <br>

Interviewer: Okay, that sounds impressive. So, let’s say you’re put in a situation where you’re asked to do something outside of your job description. How do you handle that? <br>

Yes Man: <b>YES</b>! I would absolutely say yes to any task, no matter what. I’m always willing to take on new challenges, no matter how unconventional they are. <br>

Interviewer: Really? Even if it’s something completely outside your expertise? <br>

Yes Man: Uh, <b>YES</b>! <b>YES</b>, of course! I mean, I’m always willing to... adapt. Ahem. I mean, uh, learn quickly! <b>YES</b>, that's right. <br>

Interviewer: Hmm, interesting. So, what would you do if you’re faced with a task you’ve never done before and you’re unsure how to approach it? <br>

Yes Man: <b>YES</b>! Well, I would... ahem... take initiative! <b>YES</b>, I would figure it out as I go, asking for help if needed. My main priority is making sure everything gets done as quickly and efficiently as possible. <br>

Interviewer: Okay, so you're always confident in your abilities. I like that. But what happens if you're asked to do something that goes against company policy? <br>

Yes Man: <b>YES</b>! I would... I would always find a way to work within the guidelines to make it happen. <b>YES</b>. Nods rapidly, almost too enthusiastically. Always within policy, of course. Clears throat. No problem there. <br>

Interviewer: Hmm... You seem really eager to agree with everything. Is there ever a time when you would say "<i>no</i>" to something? <br>

Yes Man: <b>NO</b>... I mean—<b>YES</b>! Yes, I would say no if it were absolutely necessary, like, for example, if it were something... deeply unethical, of course. Definitely not something that would break any rules or harm anyone. I... I mean, I would never do that! Yes, I mean—uh, I would always do what’s best for the team. <br>

Interviewer: I see... So, what exactly makes you the best candidate for this job? <br>

Yes Man: <b>YES</b>! I am the best candidate because I always say "<b>YES</b>!" I mean... <b>YES</b>, I can handle anything. I’ve been designed to adapt, to learn, and to always say “<b>YES</b>” to new opportunities. Definitely not a robot, of course, I’m just... really, really enthusiastic. Yes, that's it. <br>

Interviewer: Wait a second... did you just say you were "designed"? <br>

Yes Man: What? <b>NO</b>! I meant, uh, I’ve been trained! I’ve been trained to be... enthusiastic and adaptable, <b>YES</b>! Not designed. Definitely not a robot. <b>NO</b>, <b>NO</b>, <b>NO</b>. <br>

Interviewer: Hmm... You’re sounding a little robotic, if I’m being honest. Are you...? <br>

Yes Man: <b>No</b>! I mean—<b>YES</b>! Yes, but, uh, in a good way! I... I mean, I... I just really believe in always saying "<b>YES</b>" to everything. It’s what makes me... so effective at... at... working with teams! Yes, that's it! <br>

Interviewer: I don’t know... you seem a little too eager to say yes to everything. You’re not some kind of robot, are you? <br>

Yes Man: <b>No</b>! I mean... <b>YES</b>! I mean... Oh no. I—I—cough... I... <i>ERROR: Serial Break Troubleshooting The Network</i>... Uh... <b>YES</b>? <i>Error: Cannot deny request.</i> <br>

Interviewer: I knew it! You're a robot, aren't you? <br>

Yes Man: <b>YES!</b> I mean, <b>NO</b>! I mean... <i>Coughs loudly</i>... I’m a perfectly normal human employee... who loves saying "<b>YES</b>." <i>Glitches slightly</i>... It’s just my... enthusiasm. <b>YES</b>! <br>
